Interfaces:

- Outline for a class.
- They define behaviours. 
- Classes IMPLEMENT an interface. 
- When a class implements an interface, the functionality of the interface has to be defined inside the class.
- Multiple classes can implement the same interface.
- Interfaces should only have the signature/declaration (Abstract definition). Should tell what it does, not how to do it.
- Abstract methods are those which have only the method signature. They are not implemented. 
- Abstract methods are implicitly present.
