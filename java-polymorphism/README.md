Polymorphism:

- Feature of object oriented programming where an object of a class has the ability to be identified as more than one type.
- *Poly*(many/multi)*morph*(forms)*ism*.

Examples:
- When you consider a polygon:
    - Triangle is a polygon.
    - Square is a polygon.
    - Circle is a polygon.
    Triangle, square and circle are subclasses of the superclass polygon.
- When you consider a vehicle:
    - Car is a vehicle.
    - Bike is a vehicle.
    - Airplane is a vehicle.
    Car, bike and airplane are subclasses of the superclass vehicle.

Dynamic Polymorphism:
    - Ability of a program to take several forms after compilation (run time)
