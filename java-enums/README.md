Enums:

- Short for enumerated.
- Ordered listing of items within a collection.
- enums should be constants, meaning the values should not be changed.
Example: Days of the week, Months in a year, etc.
- Can be created in a seperate file, or in the same file, but outside the class.
- Grouping of constants which behave similarly to objects.
- Each constant can be associated with a specific value.
