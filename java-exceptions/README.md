Exceptions:

- Unexpected events which disrupt the execution of a program. These are standard pre-defined java exceptions.
    Example: ArithmeticException
- Custom exceptions - User defined exceptions. These are application specific exceptions.
    Example: InvalidUserNameException
    - User defined exceptions extend the Exception class (parent class).
    - User defined exceptions are defined inside a seperate class file (child class).
